Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

Description: Docker container platform (client package)
 Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, ship, and run
 applications. Docker lets you quickly assemble applications from components and
 eliminates the friction that can come when shipping code. Docker lets you get
 your code tested and deployed into production as fast as possible.
 .
 This package provides the "docker" client binary (and supporting files).

Description: Industry-standard container runtime
 containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on
 simplicity, robustness and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux
 and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host
 system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision,
 low-level storage and network attachments, etc.
 .
 containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being
 used directly by developers or end-users.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

Description: Industry-standard container runtime
 containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on
 simplicity, robustness and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux
 and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host
 system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision,
 low-level storage and network attachments, etc.
 .
 containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being
 used directly by developers or end-users.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

Description: Industry-standard container runtime
 containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on
 simplicity, robustness and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux
 and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host
 system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision,
 low-level storage and network attachments, etc.
 .
 containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being
 used directly by developers or end-users.

Description: The DO SDK is a Microsoft project for enabling IPC through native C++ code with the Delivery Optimization Agent for Linux
 # Delivery Optimization Client
 .
 This repository contains source code for the following DO components:
 .
 * Agent
 * SDK
 * Plug-ins
 .
 ## Agent
 .
 Delivery Optimization HTTP downloader with Microsoft Connected Cache support.
 .
 ## SDK
 .
 Library for enabling inter-process communication (IPC) with deliveryoptimization clients
 through native C++ code.
 .
 ## Plug-ins
 .
 Add-on that enables APT downloads to go through Delivery Optimization Agent.
 It is a required component only on devices that must download APT packages via a Microsoft Connected Cache instance.
 During install, it replaces itself as APT's HTTP(S) transport mechanism, thus receiving all APT downloads requests.
 .
 ## Getting Started
 .
 Follow the development machine setup on each desktop you'd like to use.
 .
 ### Development Machine Setup
 .
 Clone the repository locally from terminal:
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd (to working directory of your choosing)
 > git clone https://github.com/microsoft/do-client
 ```
 .
 Run the appropriate bootstrapper depending on development machine platform:
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd build/bootstrap
 ```
 .
 ### Building DO client components
 **NOTICE:**
 **If you are modifying this project and distributing your own custom build, please modify the DO_BUILDER_IDENTIFIER cmake variable located in https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt**
 .
 After setting up your development machine, navigate back into the project root
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd <project root>
 ```
 .
 We provide an easy-to-use python script for building our client components from the project root, you can inspect build.py for additional build flags
 On debian-based systems, run this command to build the client and package it as a .deb file
 .
 ```markdown
 > python3 build/build.py --project agent --package-for deb
 ```
 .
 Run this command to build the sdk
 .
 ```markdown
 > python3 build/build.py --project sdk --package-for deb
 ```
 .
 In order to build the plugin, you must build & install the sdk, an easy way to do this is to install the the packages you produced in the previous two steps
 .
 Navigate to the build output directory for the agent and install the agent package
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-agent/linux-debug/
 > sudo apt-get install ./deliveryoptimization-agent*.deb
 ```
 .
 The sdk produces a runtime and development package, in this case you'll want to install both
 Navigate to build output directory for the sdk and install both packages
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-sdk/linux-debug/
 > sudo apt-get install ./libdeliveryoptimization*.deb
 ```
 .
 With the sdk installed, you can now build the plugin by navigating back to the project root
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd <project root>
 > python3 build/build.py --project plugin-apt --package-for deb
 ```
 .
 At this point, you should have built and packaged all components
 .
 ### Installing DO Client components
 .
 There are a couple ways for you to install the DO client components
 .
 1. If you have built the component into a debian package, you can simply find the debian package and install like detailed above.
 This will handle installing to the appropriate paths, and also the necessary setup of DO user/group permissions needed for DO-agent.
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-sdk/linux-debug/
 > sudo apt-get install ./libdeliveryoptimization*.deb
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-agent/linux-debug/
 > sudo apt-get install ./deliveryoptimization-agent*.deb
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-plugin-apt/linux-debug/
 > sudo apt-get install ./deliveryoptimization-plugin-apt*.deb
 ```
 .
 2. If you build and install using cmake, or through some other custom means, be sure to setup the DO user/groups correctly in your installation.
 You can reference this [script](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/blob/main/client-lite/build/postinst.in.sh) to see how to setup the DO user/group and install DO as a daemon.
 .
 ### Testing DO Client components
 .
 As guidance, please ensure proper code coverage for project contributions
 Unit tests for the agent and sdk are produced as a part of the above build command, you can find them in the build output directory
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-agent/linux-debug/client-lite/test
 ```
 .
 Our tests utilize the [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) unit testing framework, which supports test filtering via command line
 You can run all agent tests by running
 .
 ```markdown
 > ./deliveryoptimization-agent-tests
 ```
 .
 You can filter for specific tests as well, reference the GTest documentation for filtering rules and syntax
 ```markdown
 > sudo ./deliveryoptimization-agent-tests --gtest_filter=DownloadManagerTests*
 ```
 .
 The test executable for the SDK is located in the sdk build output as well
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-sdk/linux-debug/sdk-cpp/tests
 ```
 .
 The sdk tests expect a running do-agent, you can either manually run the agent executable from its build output or install the agent package as you may have done while building the plugin
 You can run the sdk tests just like the agent tests
 .
 ```markdown
 > sudo ./deliveryoptimization-sdk-tests
 ```
 .
 And filter them similarly
 .
 ```markdown
 > sudo ./deliveryoptimization-sdk-tests --gtest_filter=DownloadTests*
 ```
 .
 ## Support
 .
 The APT plugin component is currently in a **Public Preview** state.  During this phase, it will be
 supported for 90 days beyond the release date of a new release.  At the end of the 90 day window,
 we will not guarantee support for the previous version.  Please plan to migrate to a newer release
 within that 90-day window to avoid any disruptions.
 .
 ## Filing a Bug
 .
 Please file a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/issues) to ensure all issues are
 tracked appropriately.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

Description: The DO SDK is a Microsoft project for enabling IPC through native C++ code with the Delivery Optimization Agent for Linux
 # Delivery Optimization Client
 .
 This repository contains source code for the following DO components:
 .
 * Agent
 * SDK
 * Plug-ins
 .
 ## Agent
 .
 Delivery Optimization HTTP downloader with Microsoft Connected Cache support.
 .
 ## SDK
 .
 Library for enabling inter-process communication (IPC) with deliveryoptimization clients
 through native C++ code.
 .
 ## Plug-ins
 .
 Add-on that enables APT downloads to go through Delivery Optimization Agent.
 It is a required component only on devices that must download APT packages via a Microsoft Connected Cache instance.
 During install, it replaces itself as APT's HTTP(S) transport mechanism, thus receiving all APT downloads requests.
 .
 ## Getting Started
 .
 Follow the development machine setup on each desktop you'd like to use.
 .
 ### Development Machine Setup
 .
 Clone the repository locally from terminal:
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd (to working directory of your choosing)
 > git clone https://github.com/microsoft/do-client
 ```
 .
 Run the appropriate bootstrapper depending on development machine platform:
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd build/bootstrap
 ```
 .
 ### Building DO client components
 **NOTICE:**
 **If you are modifying this project and distributing your own custom build, please modify the DO_BUILDER_IDENTIFIER cmake variable located in https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt**
 .
 After setting up your development machine, navigate back into the project root
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd <project root>
 ```
 .
 We provide an easy-to-use python script for building our client components from the project root, you can inspect build.py for additional build flags
 On debian-based systems, run this command to build the client and package it as a .deb file
 .
 ```markdown
 > python3 build/build.py --project agent --package-for deb
 ```
 .
 Run this command to build the sdk
 .
 ```markdown
 > python3 build/build.py --project sdk --package-for deb
 ```
 .
 In order to build the plugin, you must build & install the sdk, an easy way to do this is to install the the packages you produced in the previous two steps
 .
 Navigate to the build output directory for the agent and install the agent package
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-agent/linux-debug/
 > sudo apt-get install ./deliveryoptimization-agent*.deb
 ```
 .
 The sdk produces a runtime and development package, in this case you'll want to install both
 Navigate to build output directory for the sdk and install both packages
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-sdk/linux-debug/
 > sudo apt-get install ./libdeliveryoptimization*.deb
 ```
 .
 With the sdk installed, you can now build the plugin by navigating back to the project root
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd <project root>
 > python3 build/build.py --project plugin-apt --package-for deb
 ```
 .
 At this point, you should have built and packaged all components
 .
 ### Installing DO Client components
 .
 There are a couple ways for you to install the DO client components
 .
 1. If you have built the component into a debian package, you can simply find the debian package and install like detailed above.
 This will handle installing to the appropriate paths, and also the necessary setup of DO user/group permissions needed for DO-agent.
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-sdk/linux-debug/
 > sudo apt-get install ./libdeliveryoptimization*.deb
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-agent/linux-debug/
 > sudo apt-get install ./deliveryoptimization-agent*.deb
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-plugin-apt/linux-debug/
 > sudo apt-get install ./deliveryoptimization-plugin-apt*.deb
 ```
 .
 2. If you build and install using cmake, or through some other custom means, be sure to setup the DO user/groups correctly in your installation.
 You can reference this [script](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/blob/main/client-lite/build/postinst.in.sh) to see how to setup the DO user/group and install DO as a daemon.
 .
 ### Testing DO Client components
 .
 As guidance, please ensure proper code coverage for project contributions
 Unit tests for the agent and sdk are produced as a part of the above build command, you can find them in the build output directory
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-agent/linux-debug/client-lite/test
 ```
 .
 Our tests utilize the [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) unit testing framework, which supports test filtering via command line
 You can run all agent tests by running
 .
 ```markdown
 > ./deliveryoptimization-agent-tests
 ```
 .
 You can filter for specific tests as well, reference the GTest documentation for filtering rules and syntax
 ```markdown
 > sudo ./deliveryoptimization-agent-tests --gtest_filter=DownloadManagerTests*
 ```
 .
 The test executable for the SDK is located in the sdk build output as well
 .
 ```markdown
 > cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-sdk/linux-debug/sdk-cpp/tests
 ```
 .
 The sdk tests expect a running do-agent, you can either manually run the agent executable from its build output or install the agent package as you may have done while building the plugin
 You can run the sdk tests just like the agent tests
 .
 ```markdown
 > sudo ./deliveryoptimization-sdk-tests
 ```
 .
 And filter them similarly
 .
 ```markdown
 > sudo ./deliveryoptimization-sdk-tests --gtest_filter=DownloadTests*
 ```
 .
 ## Support
 .
 The APT plugin component is currently in a **Public Preview** state.  During this phase, it will be
 supported for 90 days beyond the release date of a new release.  At the end of the 90 day window,
 we will not guarantee support for the previous version.  Please plan to migrate to a newer release
 within that 90-day window to avoid any disruptions.
 .
 ## Filing a Bug
 .
 Please file a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/issues) to ensure all issues are
 tracked appropriately.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

 ```markdown
 &gt; cd (to working directory of your choosing)
 &gt; git clone https://github.com/microsoft/do-client
 ```
 .
 Run the appropriate bootstrapper depending on development machine platform:
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; cd build/bootstrap
 ```
 .
 ### Building DO client components
 **NOTICE:**
 **If you are modifying this project and distributing your own custom build, please modify the DO_BUILDER_IDENTIFIER cmake variable located in https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt**
 .
 After setting up your development machine, navigate back into the project root
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; cd &lt;project root&gt;
 ```
 .
 We provide an easy-to-use python script for building our client components from the project root, you can inspect build.py for additional build flags
 On debian-based systems, run this command to build the client and package it as a .deb file
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; python3 build/build.py --project agent --package-for deb
 ```
 .
 Run this command to build the sdk
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; python3 build/build.py --project sdk --package-for deb
 ```
 .
 In order to build the plugin, you must build &amp; install the sdk, an easy way to do this is to install the the packages you produced in the previous two steps
 .
 Navigate to the build output directory for the agent and install the agent package
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-agent/linux-debug/
 &gt; sudo apt-get install ./deliveryoptimization-agent*.deb
 ```
 .
 The sdk produces a runtime and development package, in this case you&apos;ll want to install both
 Navigate to build output directory for the sdk and install both packages
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-sdk/linux-debug/
 &gt; sudo apt-get install ./libdeliveryoptimization*.deb
 ```
 .
 With the sdk installed, you can now build the plugin by navigating back to the project root
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; cd &lt;project root&gt;
 &gt; python3 build/build.py --project plugin-apt --package-for deb
 ```
 .
 At this point, you should have built and packaged all components
 .
 ### Installing DO Client components
 .
 There are a couple ways for you to install the DO client components
 .
 1. If you have built the component into a debian package, you can simply find the debian package and install like detailed above.
 This will handle installing to the appropriate paths, and also the necessary setup of DO user/group permissions needed for DO-agent.
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-sdk/linux-debug/
 &gt; sudo apt-get install ./libdeliveryoptimization*.deb
 &gt; cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-agent/linux-debug/
 &gt; sudo apt-get install ./deliveryoptimization-agent*.deb
 &gt; cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-plugin-apt/linux-debug/
 &gt; sudo apt-get install ./deliveryoptimization-plugin-apt*.deb
 ```
 .
 2. If you build and install using cmake, or through some other custom means, be sure to setup the DO user/groups correctly in your installation.
 You can reference this [script](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/blob/main/client-lite/build/postinst.in.sh) to see how to setup the DO user/group and install DO as a daemon.
 .
 ### Testing DO Client components
 .
 As guidance, please ensure proper code coverage for project contributions
 Unit tests for the agent and sdk are produced as a part of the above build command, you can find them in the build output directory
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-agent/linux-debug/client-lite/test
 ```
 .
 Our tests utilize the [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) unit testing framework, which supports test filtering via command line
 You can run all agent tests by running
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; ./deliveryoptimization-agent-tests
 ```
 .
 You can filter for specific tests as well, reference the GTest documentation for filtering rules and syntax
 ```markdown
 &gt; sudo ./deliveryoptimization-agent-tests --gtest_filter=DownloadManagerTests*
 ```
 .
 The test executable for the SDK is located in the sdk build output as well
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; cd /tmp/build-deliveryoptimization-sdk/linux-debug/sdk-cpp/tests
 ```
 .
 The sdk tests expect a running do-agent, you can either manually run the agent executable from its build output or install the agent package as you may have done while building the plugin
 You can run the sdk tests just like the agent tests
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; sudo ./deliveryoptimization-sdk-tests
 ```
 .
 And filter them similarly
 .
 ```markdown
 &gt; sudo ./deliveryoptimization-sdk-tests --gtest_filter=DownloadTests*
 ```
 .
 ## Support
 .
 The APT plugin component is currently in a **Public Preview** state.  During this phase, it will be
 supported for 90 days beyond the release date of a new release.  At the end of the 90 day window,
 we will not guarantee support for the previous version.  Please plan to migrate to a newer release
 within that 90-day window to avoid any disruptions.
 .
 ## Filing a Bug
 .
 Please file a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/issues) to ensure all issues are
 tracked appropriately.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

Description: Industry-standard container runtime
 containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on
 simplicity, robustness and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux
 and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host
 system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision,
 low-level storage and network attachments, etc.
 .
 containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being
 used directly by developers or end-users.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.

Description: Microsoft Intune
 Microsoft Intune helps organizations manage access to corporate apps, data, and
 resources. Microsoft Intune is the app that lets you, as an employee of your
 company, securely access those resources.
 .
 Before you can use this app, make sure your IT admin has set up your work
 account. Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune.
 .
 Microsoft Intune helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work:
 .
 - Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email,
 and OneDrive for Business.
 - Sign in to corporate resources with company-issued certificates.
 - View and manage your enrolled devices – and wipe them if they get lost or
 stolen.
 - Get help directly from your IT department through available contact
 information.
 .
 A note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and
 will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information.
 Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have
 questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your
 company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your
 network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will
 be used by your organization.
